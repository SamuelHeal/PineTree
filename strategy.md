# Building a Cryptocurrency Trading Strategy Platform in Next.js

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **trading strategy building platform** using **Next.js**. This platform will allow users to visually create cryptocurrency trading strategies using a block-based builder, leverage an AI assistant to generate strategies, convert strategies to Pine Script for TradingView, and backtest them using real-world data.

### Key Features

1. **Visual Trading Strategy Builder**

   - A building block interface where users can create trading logic using drag-and-drop components.
   - Include support for major trading indicators and logical operations to allow for complex strategies.

2. **AI Assistant for Strategy Creation**

   - Use **Anthropic's AI API** to allow users to describe their trading strategies in natural language and automatically generate trading logic.
   - Provide an interactive chat interface to refine and improve strategies.

3. **Pine Script Conversion**

   - Convert the created trading logic into **Pine Script**, the scripting language for TradingView.

4. **Backtesting Engine**
   - Allow users to backtest their strategies using historical cryptocurrency data.
   - Provide performance metrics such as profit/loss, drawdown, and win rate.

## Technical Details

### 1. **Frontend: Strategy Builder**

- **Technology:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (for UI).
- **Libraries:**
  - `react-dnd` for drag-and-drop functionality.
  - `react-flow-renderer` for visualizing the strategy-building blocks.
  - `react-query` for API data fetching.

#### Components:

- **Indicator Blocks:**
  - Support for major trading indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands).
  - Each block should allow parameter customization (e.g., period, source).
- **Logic Blocks:**
  - Include `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `=`, etc.).
- **Execution Blocks:**

  - Define actions such as `BUY`, `SELL`, or `HOLD`.

- **Flow Canvas:**
  - An area where users can drag and connect blocks to define trading logic.

### 2. **AI Assistant for Strategy Generation**

- **Technology:** Integration with **Anthropic's AI API**.
- **Libraries:**
  - `axios` or `fetch` for API requests.

#### Features:

- **Chat Interface:**
  - Provide a conversational interface where users can describe their strategies.
  - Display AI-generated trading logic as a flowchart in the builder.
- **Custom Prompts:**
  - Send user instructions and existing strategy context to the AI for refinement.
  - Example prompt:
    ```plaintext
    "Create a strategy where RSI < 30 triggers a BUY signal, and RSI > 70 triggers a SELL signal."
    ```
- **Integration:**
  - Parse AI responses and convert them into strategy-building blocks.

---

### 3. **Pine Script Conversion**

- **Technology:** Node.js (for server-side scripting), Custom Parsers.
- **Libraries:**
  - Create a mapping between strategy blocks and Pine Script syntax.

#### Conversion Logic:

- Map each block to Pine Script code:
  - Example:
    - RSI Block → `rsi(close, 14)`
    - BUY Condition → `if rsi < 30`
- Serialize the visual strategy into a Pine Script file.
- Allow users to download the generated Pine Script.

### 4. **Backtesting Engine**

- **Technology:** Node.js, Python (optional for advanced computations), or external backtesting libraries.
- **Libraries:**
  - `ccxt` for historical cryptocurrency data.
  - `ta-lib` or similar for indicator calculations.
  - `plotly.js` for performance visualization.

#### Backtesting Workflow:

1. **Load Historical Data:**
   - Fetch data using `ccxt` (e.g., Binance, Coinbase).
   - Cache data locally for faster testing.
2. **Run Strategy Logic:**
   - Execute the Pine Script-like logic on historical data.
   - Simulate trades based on the logic and execution blocks.
3. **Metrics Calculation:**

   - Calculate performance metrics:
     - **Net Profit/Loss**
     - **Win Rate**
     - **Max Drawdown**
     - **Sharpe Ratio**

4. **Results Visualization:**
   - Display performance in an interactive graph.
   - Allow users to replay trades step-by-step.
